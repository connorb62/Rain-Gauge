# Installation
Please read the following carefully. 
Rain Gauge makes use of text files to store and log user and gauge information. When installing the application to the Programs folder, these files become inaccessible. Please make sure you install the application to outside system folders. A preferable installation location would be `Documents`. 
To install Rain Gauge, locate the installer `Rain Gauge vX.X.X.X Installer` `.exe` file and run it.

# Getting Started 
Rain Gauge makes recording, logging, graphing and summarizing rainfall easy. When installation is complete, you must add a user and a gauge. To add a use, click `Add User` on the top pane, and enter a name. To add a gauge, navigate to the 'Recording Information' pane and click `Add New`, suppling a name and max capacity. Then refresh both these fields by using the keyboard shortcuts `Ctrl + R` and `Ctrl + Q` or navigate to the menu bar. This information is then stored in a text file, so it is easily accessible upon application relaunch. 
## Adding a record
Adding a record is easy. First select a gauge and get the max capacity. Then select the date and time of reading and click `Apply`. It is important to click apply to get the correct date. Then supply the reading and weather (at time of reading) information. You can also check the if you recorded it or someone else did, and whether it was emptied. To record, click `Apply`. 

## Save or Open Records
Rain Gauge File information is stored as a `.csv`. You can save rainfall records easily as files for later use by clicking `Save` and `Open` to import saved records or by navigating to the main menu. 

## Graph and Summarize Records
Records can be easily visualized and summarized under the 'Analysis' tab sheet. Once and adequate number of records have been logged, click `Graph` to draw an area graph and `Summary` to show Total and Average rainfall as well as the period of data recording in days. 

## Printing
Records, Graphs and summaries can be printed. Navigate to the main menu and print your desired information.
